Real time interactions in oTree using Django Channels
============================================================
Auctions and real effort tasks
--------------------------------


This code contains four applications to use in oTree [Chen2016]_.

The demo app based on this code is available at Heroku_.


1. :code:`minimum`: a bare  example how to use Django Channels in oTree projects
to build a very simple real effort task (subtracting random number from X).


2. :code:`realefforttask`: a set of four different real effort tasks:

-  summing up *N* numbers [Niederle2007]_.
- finding max of two matrices [Schram2017]_.
- decoding task [Erkal2011]_.
- counting 0s in a matrix [Abeler2011]_.

This app also provides a platform for development one's own tasks using
TaskGenerator class from :code:`ret_functions` module located in :code:`realefforttask` app folder.
To use it, create a child of :code:`TaskGenerator` class in :code:`ret_functions` module, and reference it
in :code:`settings.py` configuration for your app.


3. :code:`auctionone` -  a gift-exchange game [Fehr1993]_ where employers hire workers in the
open auction, and workers reciprocate their salary in a subsequent real effort task stage.

4. :code:`double_auction` -  a trading platform where buyers and sellers can
trade their goods by posting bids (for buyers) and asks (for sellers) [Smith1962]_.
